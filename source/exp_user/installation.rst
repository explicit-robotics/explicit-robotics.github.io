We assume that users have access to recent versions of `MATLAB`_. 
*Exp[licit]-MATLAB* was tested for versions after R2022a. 
For users having issues running the software with older versions of MATLAB, please create a `Github issue`_.

To clone our `Explicit-MATLAB repository`_, run:

.. code-block:: 

	git clone https://github.com/explicit-robotics/Explicit-MATLAB.git [SET_UP_YOUR_DIRECTORY]

Once the download is complete, run MATLAB and set the current folder to be the *Exp[licit]-MATLAB* folder.
Run the ``setup.m`` script to include all subfolders. You can also run the following command in the command window:

.. code-block:: MATLAB

	setup

If the following line appeares in your command window, you are all set! 

.. code-block:: MATLAB
