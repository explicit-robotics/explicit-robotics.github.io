Introduction
============

Welcome to *Exp[licit]*-robotics! Our software can be used to model and simulate a variety of robots. The algorithms behind the software
are based on the Product of Exponentials Formula.

|

The software is created and maintained by `Moses C. Nah`_ and `Johannes Lachner`_, two researchers from the Newman Lab at MIT.
Our passion for Differential Geometry motivated us to develope this software.

|

Currently, *Exp[licit]-MATLAB* can be installed from our `Github repository`_. Explicit-c++ and Explicit-py will be available soon.
