Explicit-MATLAB 
================
We assume that users have access to recent versions of `MATLAB`_. 
Explicit-MATLAB was tested for versions after R2022a. 
For students, you might have access to `campus-wide MATLAB license`_, hence we strongly recommend downloading the recent versions of MATLAB software.
For users having issues running Explicit-MATLAB with older versions of MATLAB, please provide us feedback as a `Github issue`_.

Assuming a recent version of MATLAB software, clone our `Explicit-MATLAB repository`_:

.. code-block:: 

	git clone https://github.com/explicit-robotics/Explicit-MATLAB.git [SET_UP_YOUR_DIRECTORY]

Once the download is complete, run MATLAB and set the current folder to the Explicit-MATLAB folder.
Run ``setup.m`` script by running the following line of code at the Command Window of MATLAB:

.. code-block:: MATLAB

	setup

If the following line appeared at your Command Window, you are all set! 

.. code-block:: MATLAB
